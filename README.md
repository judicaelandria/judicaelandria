I'm a new to open source community, but so far I love contributing to open source project,
it help to be a better programmer, to learn from other developer.
I love creating things for web, I use javascript to create. Yeah I love vanilla javascript.
I enjoy creating things for mobile too using React Native. And finally I'm an apprentice designer.
That's all folks, thanks for reading and have a good day.
